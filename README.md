# ZenWave Domain Modeling Language ZDL Editor

[ZDL](https://www.zenwave360.io/docs/event-driven-design/zenwave-domain-language) is a domain specific language (DSL) for modeling Event-Driven microservices to work with **ZenWave 360ยบ**.

[ZenWave 360ยบ](https://www.zenwave360.io/) is a set of tools built on the foundations of Domain Driven Design and API-First principles for Event-Driven Architectures.

Inspired by JHipster JDL, ZDL is a language for describing DDD Bounded Contexts, including domain entities and their relationships, services, commands, events and business policies... for Event-Driven Architectures.

It's designed to be compact, readable and expressive while still retaining the language of the business experts. Business friendly, developer friendly, and machine friendly.

ZDL works well as an Ubiquitous Language format.
